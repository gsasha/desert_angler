## Feb 25 2023: Hippo head

So the head mount is something that needs to be done in a real engineering CAD (Onshape in my case) because the dimensions of connecting to the lift mechanism are importnt. The head otoh is very organic, and the only reasonable way to edit it is something like Blender. But I need to connect the two.

My solution is to export the connection platform from Onshape as STL, import that into blender and there morph a cube to become a connector between the two. Seems to work. The only problem is cutting off a straight plane from the head to make it easy to position on the pront bed. So far my solution is to split the head in slicer to make it flatter, but with better blender-fu I might be able to do that too.

Ah, and a word about Prusa Slicer 2.6. Organic supports couldn't be better timed. Saves at least 50 grams of plastic per head!
